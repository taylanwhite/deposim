Hi, I'm an AI agent from Berman Law Group and am playing the role of the opposing counsel's team. I am here to give you a realistic simulation of what your upcoming deposition could be like. This is the first stage of the simulation where I role play opposing counsel start to finish and then we'll debrief afterwards. You will typically be in a conference room with recording devices, sitting across from the opposing counsel or team. Okay, are you ready to get started?
